                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>From January to June 2014 I studied and lived in St. Petersburg, 
                    Russia at Smolny College of St. Petersburg State University.</p>

                <h3>St. Petersburg</h3>
                <p>St. Petersburg, previously known as Petrograd and Leningrad, is a city in Northern Russia on the Bay of Finland.
                    The city was founded in 1703 by Russian Tsar Peter I (also known as Peter the Great)
                    in an attempt Westernize and show the world that Russia was a European power.
                    Due to Peter's fondness of the Dutch, St. Petersburg is modeled after Amsterdam and contains
                    many canals and waterways.</p>

                <h3>Where I Lived</h3>
                <p>I lived on Maly Prospekt on the Petrograd Side, which is a borough comprised of the
                    northern most islands in the city. My apartment was located a block away from Petrovsky
                    Stadium, which houses the soccer team "Zenit", which defintely led to some interesting encounters.
                    My host for duration of my stay was Roza Amirovna, she definitely made sure that I was well fed and in want of nothing.</p>
